*Ok so ever since Dr. Ragsdell mentioned if I wanted to get a cat (or other pet, although I'm pretty sure she just mentioned cats), I've been thinking that it might be a good idea. There are some things that I need to figure out though.*

**Things To Figure Out** - 
1. How Allergic To Cats Am I?
	- This one I'm probably not going to be able to figure out until the summer (unless I can find a place that will do allergy testing here in Tennessee)
2. What Cat Breeds Are 'Hypoallergenic'?
	- There really aren't any *truly* hypoallergenic cat breeds, but some are better than others (I just hope they don't cost all that much, or that I can find them at a shelter)
3. Feasibility?
	1. How feasible is it for me to get one in general?
		- Like from a Dr. Ragsdell and parents perspective, especially with me possibly getting a car over the summer (although a cheap car)
	2. What is the cost of the 'hypoallergenic' breeds?
		- This is going to be one of the big things, especially since I will probably (I think?) not be able to get one from a shelter
	3. What is going to be the running costs?
		- Also important to know just in general, I don't want it to be too expensive
	4. Would I be able to take care of one successfully?
		- This question is more of a stress standpoint
	5. Where is a local vet and how will I get there (with my cat in tow)?
		- This is pretty self-explanatory
4. What Do I Need To Do To Keep One?
	- Because to be honest I don't really know the specifics, lol
