- Whole course assumes static equilibrium
- "Proper FBD"
- Stress - intensity of force 
- Strain - intensity of deformation
- "statically things can have the same solution, but that's not the full story"

Things To Do - 
- Review FBD's
- Review the ME 202 material, especially the stuff on applying static equilibrium to forces and moments to solve for unknown reaction forces and moments *and* internal forces and moments
- Memorize the common SI/metric prefixes from nano- to giga-
- Review the Right Hand Rule for defining positive rotations and moment directions 
- Geometry Stuff - 
	- A surface is defined by its normal direction. "Google 'surface normal' if you don't know what this means" (I'm assuming that I do in fact know what it means, but might as well check anyways) 
	- When doing 2D mechanics calculations (particularly for stress transformation), always measure angles from the positive x-axis

What The Homework Looks Like - 
- All on the textbook so far, they're in the end of each section in the textbook (the prof also seems to assign problems from different and/or particular sections)
