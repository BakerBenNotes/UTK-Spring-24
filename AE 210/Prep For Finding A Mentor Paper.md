### Stuff From Tablet On Tuesday

**List Of People To Talk About** - 
- Shawn (don't know last name) - Aerospace Engineer at SpaceX (I think it's SpaceX, could be BlueOrigin though)
- Mr. Peters - Software Engineer at Pegasus Systems
- Carl Yodes - Computer Science major, unsure on what they've been doing the past two years
- One of the senior design people maybe, if needed

**Mention Any Reference Articles/Conversations That Helped You To Decide** - 
- I didn't really use any article or conversation, but I guess I could mention the prof for this class mentioned seeing if you have any family that are engineers.
- I could also mention that I was meaning to call a family member that is an aerospace engineer at SpaceX/BlueOrigin 

**Describe Who You Want As A Mentor** - 
- This appears to be just describing who each of the mentors are, and might be difficult for people that I don't know especially well.

**Describe How You Are Connected To This Person And How You Will Reach Them** - 
- Shawn - He is the cousin of one of my parents, and I can reach out to him through the number given to me
- Mr. Peters - He was the President/Head Coach of the FRC (First Robotics Competition) team, I can reach out to him through the team's Slack
- Carl Yodes - He was a member of my FRC team a couple years before me, but he stopped by occasionally to help with technical issues. I can reach him through the team's Slack (and potentially his phone number if I have it saved).
- One of the senior SSTA members - They are the senior members of the SSTA club that I am in, and most of them are around pretty often. I can reach them either through the club's Discord server or in-person at one of the meetings.

**Describe How You Picked The Person(s)** - 
- The first thing that I asked was something along the lines of "what engineers or people with STEM careers do I know that I could reasonably get in touch with?"
- Then I gave priority to those that were aerospace engineers and/or people I know would most likely be fine with doing an interview (or whatever is needed for the later paper).

**Formatting Things** - 
- Be sure to include a properly-formatted figure with a caption, in addition to the references, following IEEE guidelines (both the citation and paper-formatting guidelines).
