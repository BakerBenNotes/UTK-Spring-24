Joining Clubs - 
- Continue to participate in SSTA
	- Need to get and then send my birth certificate to Dr. Lyne in order to do more of the rocketry-related stuff to meet ITAR compliance
- American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)
	- This one is especially important for career stuff, I should have joined at the beginning of college
- Sigma Gamma Tau (Aerospace Engineering Honor Society)
	- Probably a good idea to talk to Dr. Ragsdell about this one, just to idk make sure that if I happen to switch majors (to robotics engineering or something of the like) I won't be stuck or something

Internship Stuff - 
- Message and then call Shawn (parents' cousin) about Aerospace in general and also see if I could shadow him or intern with his company over the summer 
- Trying applying to different internships for the summer, the UTSI one is due in early March 
	- I will need to get a recommendation letter, which I am not really confident about who I should ask for that recommendation letter (maybe ask Dr. Ragsdell about it?)
